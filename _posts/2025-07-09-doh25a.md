title: 'When Algorithms Play Favorites: Lookism in the Generation and Perception of
  Faces'
openreview: hNGj4XXAEa
abstract: 'This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine learning-based
  gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic lookism, the preferential
  treatment based on appearance. In experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated
  faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I) systems tend to associate facial attractiveness
  to unrelated positive traits like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender
  classification models exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially
  among non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital identity
  systems.'
