title: We Need to Talk About Self-Fulfilling Predictions
openreview: d1oneln6nO
abstract: Some predictive systems do not merely predict, but their predictions shape
  and steer the world towards certain outcomes rather than others; they are performative.
  When predictive systems are performative, their development and deployment raises
  morally urgent challenges and places novel responsibilities on developers, deployers,
  regulators and policy-makers. While EWAF and other related communities have focused
  considerable attention on ethically significant problems regarding bias, fairness,
  and discrimination, little attention has been paid so far to the ethical challenges
  raised by performative prediction. This paper details this gap, provides a snapshot
  of ongoing work across computer science and philosophy to point out fruitful connections,
  and issues a community-wide call for action to investigate and manage performative
  prediction and the new challenges it raises.
