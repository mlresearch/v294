title: A Simulation Framework for Studying the Social Impacts of Algorithm-Based Refugee
  Matching
openreview: n67YVTpHJb
abstract: The integration chances of refugees in their host country are critically
  shaped by the contextual conditions of the location to which they are assigned upon
  arrival. Several research groups have developed algorithmic tools to optimize refugee-location
  matching, with the overall aim of improving refugees’ integration outcomes. These
  tools are used in a highly sensitive context and thus their design, social impacts,
  and potential long-term consequences need to be systematically assessed. To investigate
  such effects, we propose an agent-based simulation framework that allows to simulate
  different allocation mechanisms and to study their impacts on integration outcomes.
  We illustrate the simulation framework in the German context by comparing the current
  approach of the Königsteiner Schlüssel (i.e., quasi-random allocation) with the
  algorithm-based procedure GeoMatch. We study each procedures’ impacts on both labor
  market and social integration and assess structural effects on inequalities between
  subgroups of asylum seekers. The decision models and agents’ characteristics are
  based on the IAB-BAMF-SOEP survey of asylum seekers and refugees in Germany. Our
  study shows how agent-based models can be used to study unintended consequences
  of algorithmic allocations of asylum seekers in dynamically changing social environments.
