title: 'Ethical Implications of Mental Health Chatbots: Addressing Anthropomorphism,
  Deception, and Regulatory Gaps'
openreview: PBaWVnz9f8
abstract: Mental Health Chatbots (MHCBs) present both opportunities and ethical concerns
  in mental healthcare. While they promise greater accessibility and immediate support,
  their design and marketing may foster anthropomorphic perceptions that may lead
  to user over-reliance and potential deception. Current debates oscillate between
  optimism, emphasizing MHCBsâ€™ potential to fill gaps in mental healthcare, and skepticism,
  highlighting risks such as misinformation and inadequate regulatory oversight. However,
  both perspectives often lack a structured ethical foundation. This paper sketches
  a novel ethical framework grounded in principles entrenched in bioethics and AI
  Ethics to establish clear guidelines for responsible MHCB design and deployment.
  By shifting the focus from whether MHCBs should be used to how they should be ethically
  implemented, this framework provides concrete recommendations for policymakers,
  developers, deployers, and professional therapists to ensure MHCBs align with ethical
  and clinical standards.
