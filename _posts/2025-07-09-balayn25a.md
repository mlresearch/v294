title: 'Harmful Impacts of ML: Empirically Triangulating the Concerns and Practices
  of Developers'
openreview: lJ7hCTb1D4
abstract: Machine learning (ML) models used in decision-making tasks are known to
  bear harmful impacts. To tackle such impact, researchers have focused on developing
  tools to mitigate algorithmic fairness issues and to support ML developers in their
  algorithmic fairness-centered practices. Yet, little has been triangulated about
  the concerns and practices of ML developers towards the broader impact of ML that
  arises from complex questions of distributive unfairness and unsustainable pillars
  underlying ML models (e.g., opaque task formulation, inappropriate datasets, energy-intensive
  infrastructures). In this qualitative study, we conducted 30 semi-structured interviews
  using a convenience sampling of developers with varying educational backgrounds
  and varying experience with ML and algorithmic fairness. We surface (mis)conceptions
  and (questionable) practices around harms and their mitigation. Our study reveals
  no standard across developersâ€™ concerns and practices, and tensions developers face
  when attempting to curb the undesirable impacts of ML models. These insights triangulate
  prior results on algorithmic fairness and shed light on various unsolved theoretical,
  design, methodological, and governance challenges. Our findings constitute a vital
  step forward to support developers and our broader community in navigating this
  growing, increasingly ubiquitous, footprint of ML.
