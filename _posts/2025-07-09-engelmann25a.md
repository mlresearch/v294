title: LLMs’ Pluralistic Compatibility
openreview: xTHXlERxiz
abstract: 'Amid growing recognition of the influence of large language models (LLMs)
  on societies around the world, designers, scholars, and practitioners turn to the
  development and deployment of value pluralistic models. This extended abstract critically
  assesses emerging approaches to pluralistic alignment in LLMs. We distinguish between
  two primary strategies: procedural pluralism, which embeds pluralistic principles
  into model development processes, and behavioral pluralism, which concerns the values
  LLMs express in interaction. For each, we examine the underlying normative assumptions
  and commitments, highlighting tensions between design choices and the demands of
  pluralism. To meaningfully incorporate pluralism into LLM design, scholars must
  grapple with its conceptual complexity and contested dimensions. Crucially, this
  includes clarifying the goals of pluralistic alignment and articulating why pluralism
  matters for a given application context.'
