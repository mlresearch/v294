title: Uncovering Areas for AI Governance Tools Refinement through Real-World Use
  Case Analysis from Canada, Chile and Singapore
openreview: IuBoBlN9Ag
abstract: Governments and organizations around the world in most jurisdictions have
  begun to operationalize principles establishing goals for fair, explainable, robust
  and trustworthy AI systems through AI governance tools. AI governance tools, socio-technical
  tools for assessing AI systems and their risks, are used to implement AI governance
  laws and policies. Understanding the types of measurements and analytical methods
  embedded within them and evaluating how these tools are implemented in various contexts
  helps to ensure they effectuate legal and policy goals. The research presented in
  this paper compares and analyzes the implementation of AI governance tools from
  Canada, Chile and Singapore. The analysis articulates commonalities among the tools
  and their implementations and illuminates areas for further analysis and potential
  refinement in relation to application and interpretation of the metrics and measures
  used by the tools, implementation of the tools themselves, as well as interests
  and motivations of tool end users. A key conclusion suggests that although AI governance
  tools require adequate assessment before they are made available, in some cases,
  it may be necessary to put some of these tools to use in context in order to articulate
  otherwise unknown or obscured shortcomings and areas of opportunity for adjustment,
  refinement, and improvement.
