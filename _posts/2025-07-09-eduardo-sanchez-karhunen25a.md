title: 'Bias in Intent Detection: A Dynamical Systems Perspective'
openreview: TT4XbgGC3N
abstract: 'Intent detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP),
  powering applications such as chatbots and dialogue systems. Although deep learning
  models have greatly improved intent classification, their internal mechanisms remain
  poorly understood, raising concerns about transparency and fairness. Recent studies
  have applied dynamical systems theory to analyze RNNs by examining their internal
  state dynamics. We propose a novel bias evaluation framework that examines sentence
  trajectories within the model’s state space. By analyzing the dynamic evolution
  of hidden states and their final alignment with decision-making layers, we identify
  key mechanisms for defining new bias metrics: trajectory sparsity, final state clustering,
  and readout vector alignment. This interpretable framework offers a principled approach
  to diagnosing and mitigating bias.'
