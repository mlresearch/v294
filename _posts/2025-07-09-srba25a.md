title: Model-based Algorithmic Auditing of Social Media AI Algorithms
openreview: 1vb5AEsE2a
abstract: This position paper introduces a novel paradigm for oversight of social
  media AI algorithms, called the model-based algorithmic auditing. In general, the
  algorithmic auditing is a process of automated dynamic black-box assessment of real-world
  software system behavior. In a so-called sockpuppeting audit, impostor bots stimulate
  the platform with a simulated user behavior and observe the responses of the audited
  system (e.g., a recommender system). Algorithmic auditing is able to disclose interesting
  traits of AI systems (e.g., biases), which may be otherwise opaque. However, technical
  and methodological difficulties make audits costly, hard to reproduce, and hard
  to transfer cross-platform and cross-domain. To overcome this, the model-based algorithmic
  auditing introduces a platform-agnostic social media model which provides a simplified
  and aggregated representation of users, content, and interactions between them.
  The model supports or even automates challenging steps of the audit, like assisting
  human experts in creation of abstract audit scenarios, or predicting next user interactions.
  The reduction of manual effort makes the auditing more representative, cross-platform,
  and longitudinal, ultimately enabling more efficient oversight of social media algorithms
  by regulators, auditors and other stakeholders.
