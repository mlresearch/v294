title: Stochastic Fairness Interventions Are Arbitrary
openreview: xQCwfeE6Xu
abstract: 'Bias mitigation techniques offer the opportunity to intervene on statistical
  models so to reduce the risk that these will discriminate towards certain groups.
  These techniques rely on learning a mapping from the sensitive data $S$ to some
  decision variable $\hat{Y}$, usually mediated by the non-sensitive covariates $X$.
  Some of the methods available in this space propose to learn a stochastic mapping,
  which has several theoretical benefits from a computational perspective: namely,
  randomization makes it possible to compute certain mitigation objectives, and widens
  the search space for “optimal” models. From the perspective of procedural fairness,
  however, stochastic mappings may imply arbitrary decisions. In this paper, we study
  and discuss the distribution of arbitrariness in popular randomized bias mitigation
  techniques which are currently available in standard fairness toolkits. We find
  that individuals belonging to different groups may have different risks for arbitrariness;
  furthermore, we observe different patterns of arbitrariness for different randomized
  mitigation strategies, and discuss possible causes for this general phenomenon.'
