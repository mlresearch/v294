title: 'Exposing Hidden Vulnerabilities: A privacy audit of algorithmic fairness'
openreview: k2yg9X1fo4
abstract: 'Algorithmic fairness and privacy are cornerstones of trustworthy machine
  learning. Prior research suggests that mitigating bias may amplify membership inference
  risks for underrepresented groups. However, evaluations based on average-case metrics,
  such as attack success rate, often obscure vulnerabilities at low false-positive
  rates-an regime critical for real-world privacy. In this paper, we present an in-depth
  empirical study of membership inference under low false positive rate conditions,
  across three fair machine learning algorithms. Our analysis on the Law School, Bank
  Marketing, and COMPAS datasets reveal that standard threshold-based and population-based
  attacks underestimate privacy leaks, especially for sensitive subgroups. Motivated
  by this gap, we propose a subgroup-specific membership inference attack based on
  pairwise likelihood ratio tests. Our method models the null hypothesis more accurately:
  a target sampleâ€™s outputs are statistically indistinguishable from those of non-members
  within the same sensitive subgroup. Our experiments show that a simple modification
  of an existing attack can achieve superior test power across the TPR-FPR curve-even
  at extremely low false positive rates, given an adversary with the same computational
  resources and access to data-establishing a robust foundation for more powerful,
  fine-grained privacy audits of fair learning algorithms.'
