title: A Benchmark for Client-level Fairness in Federated Learning
openreview: itlJ4B99p
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
  participating clients’ local data privacy. However, the diverse data distributions
  across different clients can exacerbate fairness issues, as biases in client data
  may propagate across the Federation. Although various approaches have been proposed
  to enhance fairness in FL, they typically focus on mitigating the bias of a single
  binary-sensitive attribute. This narrow focus often overlooks the complexity introduced
  by clients with conflicting or diverse fairness objectives. Such clients may contribute
  to the Federation without experiencing any improvement in their model’s performance
  or fairness regarding their specific sensitive attributes. To evaluate Fair FL methods
  for global and individual client fairness in a reproducible and reliable manner,
  the need for standardized datasets becomes apparent. In this paper, we propose a
  preliminary framework to create benchmarking datasets that allow researchers and
  developers to evaluate Fair FL methods. These benchmarking datasets include various
  heterogeneous client settings with regard to data bias of sensitive attributes for
  assessing fairness at the global and individual level. Additionally, we provide
  information on how to evaluate results obtained with these benchmarking datasets.
