title: Invisible Inequalities - Intersectional Fairness in Educational AI
openreview: F2NxoSR706
abstract: "Drawing on feminist theories of Intersectionality, this paper explores
  how single-axis approaches to fairness assessments obscure the experiences of individuals
  facing intersecting forms of discrimination. Three case studies in educational AI
  illustrate how individualsâ€™ social embeddedness shapes their educational trajectories
  and why fairness metrics often fail to account for these complexities. The paper
  argues that addressing invisible inequalities requires a shift from purely technical
  solutions to context-sensitive fairness evaluations that ,\r section = {Extended
  Abstracts}center on the lived experiences of marginalized people."
