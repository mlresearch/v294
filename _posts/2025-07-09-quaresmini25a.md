title: 'The epistemic dimension of algorithmic fairness: assessing its impact in innovation
  diffusion and fair policy making'
openreview: MKD0rgA91h
abstract: 'Algorithmic fairness is an expanding field that addresses a range of discrimination
  issues associated with algorithmic processes. However, most works in the literature
  focus on analyzing it only from an ethical perspective, focusing on moral principles
  and values that should be considered in the design and evaluation of algorithms,
  while disregarding the epistemic dimension related to knowledge transmission and
  validation. However, this aspect of algorithmic fairness should also be included
  in the debate, as it is crucial to introduce a specific type of harm: an individual
  may be systematically excluded from the dissemination of knowledge due to the attribution
  of a credibility deficit/excess. In this work, we specifically focus on characterizing
  and analyzing the impact of this credibility deficit or excess on the diffusion
  of innovations on a societal scale, a phenomenon driven by individual attitudes
  and social interactions, and also by the strength of mutual connections. Indeed,
  discrimination might shape the latter, ultimately modifying how innovations spread
  within the network. In this light, to incorporate, also from a formal point of view,
  the epistemic dimension in innovation diffusion models becomes paramount, especially
  if these models are intended to support fair policy design. For these reasons, we
  formalize the epistemic properties of a social environment, by extending the well-established
  Linear Threshold Model (LTM) in an epistemic direction to show the impact of epistemic
  biases in innovation diffusion. Focusing on the impact of epistemic bias in both
  open-loop and closed-loop scenarios featuring optimal fostering policies, our results
  shed light on the pivotal role the epistemic dimension might have in the debate
  of algorithmic fairness in decision-making.'
