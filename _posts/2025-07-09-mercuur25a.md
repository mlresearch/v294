title: 'A Five-Phase Framework for Fair Insurance: Reviewing Strategies for Digital
  Price Differentiation'
openreview: Je1oVzS9d1
abstract: 'Insurers increasingly use machine learning to assess financial risk and
  determine personalized premiums with the aim of ensuring income and financial stability.
  Despite the recent focus on fairness, insurance companies and software developers
  struggle to bridge the gap between fairness principles and practical implementation.
  Justifying digital price differentiation in terms of both fairness and profit is
  a socio-technical problem: it requires an integration of organizational processes,
  ethical-legal considerations on indirect discrimination, and technical fairness
  metrics and mitigation techniques. The paper proposes a structured list of 33 strategies
  designed to help organizations navigate these challenges, derived from a survey
  of Dutch insurance professionals, a systematic review of academic literature, and
  expert evaluations. The strategies are organized into five phases: Understand, Determine,
  Adjust, Evaluate and Communicate, with a particular emphasis on aligning fairness
  principles with actuarial accuracy and compliance with legal standards. This work
  contributes to the literature by offering an overview of actionable strategies that
  go beyond fairness metrics, addressing both technical and social aspects of digital
  price differentiation. Practically, the strategy list supports insurance professionals
  — including data scientists, actuaries, auditors, compliance officers, and communication
  staff — by (1) providing a comprehensive overview of strategies to balance fairness
  and profitability in digital price differentiation, and (2) offering a framework
  to structure organizational processes and internal communication around this balance.'
