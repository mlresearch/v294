title: 'Overcoming Fairness Trade-offs via Pre-processing: A Causal Perspective'
openreview: L8pm9Q8H5D
abstract: 'Training machine learning models for fair decisions faces two key challenges:
  The fairness-accuracy trade-off results from enforcing fairness which weakens its
  predictive performance in contrast to an unconstrained model. The incompatibility
  of different fairness metrics poses another trade-off - also known as the impossibility
  theorem. Recent work identifies the bias within the observed data as a possible
  root cause and shows that fairness and predictive performance are in accord when
  predictive performance is measured on unbiased data. We offer a causal explanation
  for these findings using the framework of the FiND (fictitious and normatively desired)
  world, a "fair" world, where protected attributes have no causal effects on the
  target variable. Our contribution is twofold: First, we unify insights from previously
  separate lines of research and establish a new theoretical link that demonstrates
  how both the fairness-accuracy and the trade-off between conflicting fairness metrics
  are naturally resolved in this FiND world. Second, we propose appFiND, a new method
  for evaluating the quality of the FiND world approximation via pre-processing in
  real-world scenarios where the true FiND world is not observable. In simulations
  and empirical studies, we demonstrate that these pre-processing methods are successful
  in approximating the FiND world and resolving both trade-offs. Our results provide
  actionable solutions for practitioners to achieve fairness and high predictive performance
  simultaneously.'
