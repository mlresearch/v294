title: 'From Implicit to Explicit Assumptions: Why There is No Fairness Without Bias-Awareness'
openreview: KQqzj6TeFe
abstract: This extended abstract is a follow-up to our previous work –“Patriarchy
  Hurts Men Too.” Does Your Model Agree? A Discussion on Fairness Assumptions.– We
  discuss why implicit assumptions for fairness are tied to specific properties of
  the bias present in the data and why, without explicit assumptions, the choice of
  the correct model might be difficult. Moreover, we state a new result on one of
  these possible assumptions, proving the validity of the approach.
