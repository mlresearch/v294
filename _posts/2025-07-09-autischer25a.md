title: 'AI Certification and Assessment Catalogues: Practical Use and Challenges in
  the Context of the European AI Act'
openreview: 232eCeiUwL
abstract: Certifying artificial intelligence (AI) systems remains a complex task,
  particularly as AI development has moved beyond traditional software paradigms.
  We investigate the certification of AI systems, focusing on the practical application
  and limitations of existing certification catalogues, by attempting to certify a
  publicly available AI system. We aim to evaluate how well current approaches work
  to effectively certify an AI system, and how AI systems, that might not be actively
  maintained or initially intended for certification, can be selected and used for
  a sample certification process. Our methodology involves leveraging the Fraunhofer
  AI Assessment Catalogue as a comprehensive tool to systematically assess an AI modelâ€™s
  compliance with certification standards, focusing on reliability and fairness. We
  find that while the catalogue effectively structures the evaluation process, it
  can also be cumbersome and time-consuming to use. We observe the limitations of
  an AI system that has no active development team any more and highlight the importance
  of complete system documentation. Finally, we identify some limitations of the used
  certification catalogues and propose ideas on how to streamline the certification
  process.
