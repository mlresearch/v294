title: Situating and Understanding Machine Unlearning, Ethically
openreview: DvdhagDbFT
abstract: 'Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove unwanted data and its effects from
  machine learning models while preserving performance. Driven by ethical and legal
  concerns such as privacy (Right to be Forgotten), security, bias mitigation, and
  copyright protection, MU faces challenges, including technical limitations, ethical
  ambiguities, and conflicting stakeholder expectations. This paper critically examines
  MU’s motivations and effectiveness, arguing that it remains unclear 1) what MU does,
  2) what it should do, and 3) how efforts and goals fit together. To clarify, I introduce
  a tripartite epistemological distinction: 1) never knowing X, 2) learning X and
  forgetting it, and 3) acting as if one doesn’t know X. Analyzing cases of copyright,
  data privacy, and intellectual property, the paper shows inconsistencies between
  MU’s goals and outcomes, stressing a need for clearer ethics, stakeholder engagement,
  and transparency. Refining MU is crucial to ensuring that it effectively serves
  its intended purposes.'
