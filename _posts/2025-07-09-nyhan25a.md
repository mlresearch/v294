title: 'Algorithmic Transparency: The EU Digital Services Act and Young People’s Experiences
  of Online Platforms'
openreview: NOkjQDiIVe
abstract: The EU Digital Services Act (DSA) is currently being enforced across the
  EU, and several countries are introducing online safety regulations. As efforts
  to regulate digital spaces continue, so does evidence highlighting risks young people
  face from inappropriate content online, raising concerns about potential long-term
  psychological harm. To explore how the experiences of young people on large online
  platforms, such as TikTok and Instagram, align with the focus of transparency obligations
  under the DSA, this paper provides details of a project that designed a series of
  stakeholder engagement studies. The project aims to demonstrate how engaging directly
  with young people on their experiences online is a vital measure to both inform
  the progress of the DSA and guide its implementation across the EU.
