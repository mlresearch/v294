title: 'Fake Transparency: When Mobile Apps Say One Thing but Do Another'
openreview: vfC0JrHenF
abstract: "Mobile apps are extensively used. Transparency about the use of personal
  data is a requirement, both from a legal perspective and from an ethical perspective:
  users should know what data is accessed by these applications and how it is treated
  afterwards.\r Sharing sensitive information with third parties can result in negative
  consequences for the data owner due to biased algorithms. Consent is necessary,
  as well as awareness that this will happen; the right to fair information is violated
  otherwise, particularly for collectives such as minors, who cannot consent to this
  processing.\r To help prevent these problems, we propose an audit system in which
  conflicts between declarations made to users and declarations that accompany the
  software executed on mobile devices are detected. Our thesis is that this is feasible
  and beneficial for end users, developers, and other agents involved in app preparation."
