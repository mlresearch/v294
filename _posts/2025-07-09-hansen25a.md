title: 'Exclusion or Efficiency: Understanding Perspectives about AI Ethics Among
  Charity Workers in the United Kingdom'
openreview: Q65o1Z9Ghl
abstract: The widespread use of AI tools across society has impacted many different
  individuals, organizations and stakeholders. The ethical issues that arise are of
  great focus of academic research, but there is significantly less engagement with
  the different types of organizations effected, particularly how the charity sector
  is effected. I conducted a pilot empirical study consisting of semi-structured qualitative
  interviews with three employees that work in some capacity with data or technology
  at a charity, from three different charities that operate in the United Kingdom.
  This work offers insight into the unique challenges and perspectives faced by charities.
  I found that they view the ethical risk of AI primarily through its ability to be
  an exclusionary tool, and view the positives of AI primarily through its ability
  to be an efficiency tool.
