title: Investigating Popularity Bias Amplification in Recommender Systems Employed
  in the Entertainment Domain
openreview: r8xF07H4o3
abstract: Recommender systems have become an integral part of our daily online experience
  by analyzing past user behavior to suggest relevant content in entertainment domains
  such as music, movies, and books. Today, they are among the most widely used applications
  of AI and machine learning. Consequently, regulations and guidelines for trustworthy
  AI, such as the European AI Act, which addresses issues like bias and fairness,
  are highly relevant to the design, development, and evaluation of recommender systems.
  One particularly important type of bias in this context is popularity bias, which
  results in the unfair underrepresentation of less popular content in recommendation
  lists. This work summarizes our research on investigating the amplification of popularity
  bias in recommender systems within the entertainment sector. Analyzing datasets
  from three entertainment domains, music, movies, and anime, we demonstrate that
  an itemâ€™s recommendation frequency is positively correlated with its popularity.
  As a result, user groups with little interest in popular content receive less accurate
  recommendations compared to those who prefer widely popular items. Furthermore,
  this work contributes to a better understanding of the connection between recommendation
  accuracy, calibration quality of algorithms, and popularity bias amplification.
