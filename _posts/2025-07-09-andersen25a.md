title: 'Beyond Fairness: Trans Unliveability in European Algorithmic Assemblages'
openreview: nBder6guVi
abstract: The implementation of algorithmic technologies in Europe is intended to
  streamline identification, verification and security measures. In reality, they
  automate surveillance, exclusion and violence towards bodies that do not fit the
  encoded binarity of gender underpinning algorithms, which exposes trans bodies in
  particular to heightened forms of algorithmic violence. This paper argues that (1)
  trans people and their liveability are subjected to disproportionate violence perpetuated
  by European algorithmic assemblages, (2) that the concept of ‘fairness’ is inadequate
  to address the intimate facets of algorithmic violence embedded within these algorithmic
  assemblages, and (3) that the crucial aspect of liveability has been neglected by
  most scholarship - altogether placing trans lives at serious risk of aggravated
  violence and unliveability in Europe.
