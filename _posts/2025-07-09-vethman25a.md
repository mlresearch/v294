title: 'Detecting Discrimination in Job Vacancies: A Critical Reflection on the Potential
  of AI Language Models'
openreview: cmLsqQ4auQ
abstract: Explicit discrimination in job vacancies by using terms that refer to the
  candidate’s background is illegal. Yet, it is still present in numerous vacancies,
  as was recently observed in the Netherlands. Labour market authorities have organized
  efforts for the detection of explicit discrimination, which are based on the detection
  of terms such as "young" or "male". However, many non-discriminatory phrases also
  contain these terms, such as "we are a young company" or "working with male patients".
  This results in a labour-intensive task to identify discriminatory job vacancies
  and act on them. AI language models are seen as promising innovations that may improve
  efficiency. Yet, their use by governmental bodies raises concerns and requires caution.
  In this paper, we critically examine the potential of AI and language models to
  support labour market authorities in detecting explicit discrimination. We do this
  through an investigation of the potential efficiency gain whilst centring user needs.
  For this, we first create a labelled data set concerning gender discrimination and
  investigate a variety of models in their ability to detect known and unforeseen
  discriminating terms in context. Results show that these methods can support detecting
  explicit gender discrimination by bringing substantial gains to precision and make
  sensible suggestions for new terms to detect in vacancies. We complement this with
  a critical reflection based on interviews with ten experts. They state that considerations
  on responsibly using AI and language models go beyond efficiency, emphasizing the
  importance of the underlying goal of discrimination detection. Is this goal reached
  within a reasonable investment and with acceptable side-effects? In conclusion,
  this applied use case demonstrated that AI and language models could meaningfully
  bring efficiency to labour market authorities’ efforts to detect explicit discrimination
  in job vacancies. However, we advocate that, even for technologies used for common
  good, critical reflections beyond efficiency are needed to decide between AI and
  non-AI alternatives.
