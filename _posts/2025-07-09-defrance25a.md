title: 'ABCFair: an Adaptable Benchmark approach for Comparing Fairness methods'
openreview: 1SSGRBWSm1
abstract: "Numerous methods have been implemented that pursue fairness with respect
  to sensitive features by mitigating biases in machine learning. Yet, the problem
  settings that each method tackles vary significantly, including the stage of intervention,
  the composition of sensitive features, the fairness notion, and the distribution
  of the output. Even in binary classification, these subtle differences make it highly
  complicated to benchmark fairness methods, as their performance can strongly depend
  on exactly how the bias mitigation problem was originally framed.\r Hence, we introduce
  ABCFair, a benchmark approach which allows adapting to the desiderata of the real-world
  problem setting, enabling proper comparability between methods for any use case.
  In this extended abstract provide a summary from the results of applying ABCFair
  to a range of pre-, in-, and postprocessing methods on both large-scale, traditional
  datasets and on a dual label (biased and unbiased) dataset to sidestep the fairness-accuracy
  trade-off."
