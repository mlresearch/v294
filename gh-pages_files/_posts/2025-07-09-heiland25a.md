title: The social construction of algorithms and the limits of algorithmic transparency
openreview: 8N9ZfsWuUb
abstract: Algorithms increasingly govern social and economic processes, yet their
  mechanisms often remain opaque to the public. This paper explores the limits of
  algorithmic transparency by combining theoretical considerations with empirical
  findings from a study on platform-mediated food delivery work. While transparency
  is commonly proposed as a solution to mitigate algorithmic opacity and promote fairness,
  we argue that transparency alone is insufficient because it often fails to translate
  into practical understanding or meaningful agency for users. Technical transparency
  may be obstructed by trade secrecy, technical complexity, and the dynamic nature
  of machine learning systems. Moreover, even when transparency is achieved, users
  may continue to act on alternative theories about algorithmic functioning, as demonstrated
  in our study. This highlights that algorithmic governance is co-constructed through
  social processes, user interpretations, and technological affordances. We conclude
  that efforts to improve algorithmic accountability must move beyond technical transparency
  and address the social dynamics that shape algorithmic systems in practice.
