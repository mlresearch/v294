title: 'Anticipating Risks and Identifying Governance Measures for the Use of genAI
  and FPT: Citizens’ Perspectives Across Six Countries'
openreview: QyDl2Fok2E
abstract: With the increasingly rapid development and release of AI systems, policy
  discourses primarily take place on an expert level. Aiming to broaden the discourse,
  we propose the exploration of laypeople’s informed opinions as a measure to evaluate
  the social impact of AI systems, and to inform forward-looking policies. We conceived
  and organized a dialogue series, the \textit{Global AI Dialogues}, inviting citizens
  around the world to engage, discuss, and contribute their perspectives on AI. The
  goal was to better understand how people worldwide evaluate the (social) impact
  of AI on their everyday lives today and in the future, given the real-world challenges
  of their local contexts. During the dialogues, 284 participants across six countries
  (Germany, Nigeria, Japan, India, Mexico, Bolivia) critically engaged with what a
  desirable future in light of generative AI (genAI) and Facial Processing Technologies
  (FPT) could look like. They explored the consequences of technology deployment,
  assessed risks, mapped stakeholders, and derived measures to achieve a desirable
  goal. We contribute to the workshop by presenting a participatory procedure to identify
  high-priority risks and where to focus governance efforts, from the perspective
  of citizens.
