title: Influence of Label and Selection Bias on Fairness Interventions
openreview: 78uQoZoc2N
abstract: Bias can be introduced in different ways in machine learning datasets, with
  the bias type influencing the effectiveness of fairness interventions. In this work,
  we model fair worlds and their biased counterparts by introducing controlled label
  and selection bias in real-life datasets with low discrimination. We then analyze
  the resulting prediction models, with or without bias mitigation. Our results provide
  some guidance on the use of reweighing, massaging and Fairness Through Unawareness,
  and show that other dataset characteristics also play a role on fairness intervention
  efficiency, calling for further research.
