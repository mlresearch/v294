title: Re-evaluating the role of refugee integration factors for building more equitable
  allocation algorithms
openreview: x1Z7LHdmw5
abstract: Numerous studies in the social sciences have examined how individual and
  location-level characteristics influence refugees’ integration outcomes. A more
  recent, smaller body of computational research has developed algorithmic tools that
  aim to improve refugee integration by optimizing matching to resettlement locations
  based on predicted outcomes. These tools, which are piloted in a number of countries,
  raise a number of concerns. This includes, first, their reliance on a narrow set
  of individual-level predictors – most of which are protected attributes under global
  anti-discrimination laws – overlooking valuable insights from migration studies
  that may improve predictive accuracy. Second, they guide refugee placement decisions
  without assessing group fairness, potentially reinforcing existing inequalities.
  Against this background, we draw on comprehensive refugee panel data from Germany
  and study the economic integration of refugees through the lens of predictive modeling.
  Specifically, we develop prediction models that integrate and test a wide range
  of integration factors from migration research. We then compare our extended model
  configurations with existing refugee-location matching algorithms, and evaluate
  group model performance to assess generalizability and fairness. Overall, we highlight
  the importance of integrating insights from migration studies into the development
  of algorithmic decision-making tools to improve their reliability and promote fair
  outcomes across diverse groups.
