title: Towards a system-theoretic approach to algorithmic (un)fairness
openreview: BRt3ddek08
abstract: 'Most scholarship on algorithmic fairness understands fairness as a static
  problem that is addressed in the design of the algorithm and its components, overlooking
  its embedding in complex contexts of use and governance. This static framing limits
  the applicability of existing approaches to algorithmic fairness in new domains,
  where stakeholders lack established fairness norms and analogies to other fields
  may fall short. This paper examines the challenges of operationalizing algorithmic
  fairness in new contexts through a system-theoretic lens. Using a case study on
  algorithmic systems for managing grid congestion in electrical distribution grids,
  we identify three core challenges: (1) anticipating situations of unacceptably unfair
  outcomes, (2) localizing contributing factors, and (3) identifying interventions
  and associated responsibilities to prevent such outcomes. Drawing on system safety,
  a discipline that has dealt with complex safety problems in algorithmic systems
  for decades, we propose concepts and tools to support a system-theoretic approach
  to fairness.'
