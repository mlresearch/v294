title: 'Toward developing a Social Impact Assessment for AI in the public sector (SIA4AI)
  framework: key design considerations'
openreview: 0qypUhBPxZ
abstract: The rapid development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in
  the public sector necessitate a structured approach to assess their societal impacts.
  This research focuses on identifying key design considerations for a Social Impact
  Assessment for AI (SIA4AI) framework tailored to AIâ€™s unique challenges and opportunities
  in the public sector. We address the limitations of existing AI impact assessment
  methodologies, which often take a top-down approach, focusing primarily on technical
  and ethical concerns while overlooking broader societal implications. Through an
  analysis of different assessment methodologies, we identify key design considerations
  to guide the development of a SIA4AI framework. This framework aims to ensure AI
  systems align with the values and priorities of diverse citizen groups, particularly
  vulnerable social groups, to promote societal benefits and mitigate potential harms
  of AI systems in the public sector.
