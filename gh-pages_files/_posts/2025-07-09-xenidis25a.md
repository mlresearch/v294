title: Standardising Equality in the Algorithmic Society? A Research Agenda
openreview: ltJcERRzMC
abstract: In 2024, the EU adopted the AI Act, a new set of rules for trustworthy artificial
  intelligence. This legal instrument carves a large place for standardisation, a
  regulatory technique that consists in crafting so-called harmonised technical standards,
  to facilitate legal compliance by industry stakeholders. While EU technical standards
  have been used in the past for ensuring product safety, for the first time the AI
  Act relies on standardisation to facilitate compliance with fundamental rights,
  including the right to non-discrimination and equality. The attempt to translate
  inherently open-textured rights and ethical principles into operationalizable standards
  raises critical questions. In particular, how will standardisation practices under
  the new EU AI Act affect, transform, contest and stabilise notions of equality and
  non-discrimination in an increasingly algorithmic society? This paper proposes a
  research agenda to address this question and unpack the black box of AI standardisation.
