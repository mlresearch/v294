title: Facial Demography Analysis of the LAION Dataset
openreview: Ehl7g8XMUk
abstract: Large-scale image-text datasets have become fundamental building blocks
  for modern AI systems, raising concerns about the demographic biases they may encode
  and propagate. We present a comprehensive analysis of LAION, one of the largest
  and most influential datasets in this domain, focusing on demographic representation
  and intersectional biases across age, gender and race. Our methodology combines
  state-of-the-art face detection (RetinaFace) with specialized demographic classifiers
  (FairFace and EMO-AffectNet) to analyze a random sample of 500,000 image URLs from
  ReLAION-2B-en, yielding over 37,000 faces. We analyze both general representational
  biases, revealing severe overrepresentation of certain groups-such as white people
  and individuals aged 20-29-and intersectional biases, notably the underrepresentation
  of women over 30 years old and non-White infants. These results highlight the importance
  of considering not just individual demographic attributes, but their intersections
  when evaluating and mitigating bias in large-scale datasets.
