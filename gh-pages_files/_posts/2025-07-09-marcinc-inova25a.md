title: Towards Trustworthy Multi-stakeholder Recommender Systems
openreview: 400b9nOZLc
abstract: Recommender system (RS) nowadays has to reflect, combine, and solve often
  contrasting requirements and expectations from dozens of stakeholders. In fact,
  the problem is even more complicated as each of the stakeholders can simultaneously
  have various objectives creating a diverse and complicated environment with several
  stakeholders and their objectives in which a RS operates. To address this problems
  the Multi-objective and Multi-stakeholder RS have been studied in the literature.
  However, a limited attention has been paid to trustworthiness aspects of such RS,
  which slowly becomes a new standard. In this paper, we highlight open challenges
  and important questions which need to be addressed on the way to trustworthy Multi-stakeholder
  RS.
