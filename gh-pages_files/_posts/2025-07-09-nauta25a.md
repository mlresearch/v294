title: How is the Socio-Demographic Background of Researchers in AI & ML Related to
  the Values reflected in their Research?
openreview: PsCPg3LM8m
abstract: 'In this work we investigate the socio-demographic factors influencing the
  production of influential Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
  research. This work builds upon prior work, which identified a predominance of power-centralizing
  values and an underrepresentation of user rights and ethical principles in AI &
  ML publications, this study analyzes whether the socio-demographic composition of
  authors influences the prevalence of these values. An initial dataset (seed publications)
  was analyzed with the most cited publications presented at top-tier conferences
  NeurIPS and ICML in four selected years: 2008, 2009, 2018, and 2019. Then, an enriched
  dataset with all publications in the same conferences and years is constructed from
  open-access research platforms such as Semantic Scholar and Open Alex. Publications
  are identified as closely related to one of two groups derived from initial annotations
  in the seed publications: (i) moral group and (ii) non-moral group. This is achieved
  by computing jaccard similarity reference overlap between paper publications and
  constructing a similarity-based network, followed by backbone extraction and ego
  network extraction. Diversity scores for research collaborations are calculated
  enabling a statistical analysis with the two groups of publications. Results from
  human validation reveal that despite the developed method successfully constructs
  a similarity-based measure, it does not reliably infer shared moral values. Publications
  closely tied to a publication categorized as moral do not necessarily share the
  same values, despite having a high overlap based on shared references. Additional
  results show that the diversity characteristics of research collaborations in both
  groups do not have a statistically significant relationship with the moral classification.
  While there is some diversity, the general observations, however, show a significant
  underrepresentation of women and a concentration of researchers from a few nationalities,
  elite institutions, and technology companies, predominantly from the global north.'
