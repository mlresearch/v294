title: Investigating fair data acquisition for risk prediction in resource-constrained
  settings
openreview: tOuudbFZlR
abstract: Clinical prediction models (CPMs) play a crucial role in precision medicine,
  enabling the identification of high-risk patients for targeted interventions. In
  many settings, additional covariates may be collected to improve risk prediction,
  but doing so for the entire population may not be feasible due to resource constraints.
  A key challenge is to determine who should receive these additional resource-intensive
  assessments in an efficient and equitable manner. Here, we explore policies to select
  which patients should be selected for additional testing based on a baseline risk
  estimate. We investigate these policies in the context of an integrated risk tool
  for cardiovascular disease. This explores how the application of a more complex,
  and expensive, CPM on a subset of the population can improve fairness. The proposed
  methodological approaches have the potential to guide future application of CPMs
  to prioritise patient populations who would most benefit from access to additional
  investigations and access to more complex CPMs.
