title: What is Fairness? On Protected Attributes and Fictitious Worlds
openreview: t4y7cWzg8p
abstract: A growing body of literature in fairness-aware machine learning (fairML)
  aims to mitigate machine learning (ML)-related unfairness in automated decision-making
  (ADM) by defining metrics that measure fairness of an ML model and by proposing
  methods to ensure that trained ML models achieve low scores on these metrics. However,
  the underlying concept of fairness, i.e., the question of what fairness is, is rarely
  discussed, leaving a significant gap between centuries of philosophical discussion
  and the recent adoption of the concept in the ML community. In this work, we try
  to bridge this gap by formalizing a consistent concept of fairness and by translating
  the philosophical considerations into a formal framework for the training and evaluation
  of ML models in ADM systems. We argue that fairness problems can arise even without
  the presence of protected attributes (PAs), and point out that fairness and predictive
  performance are not irreconcilable opposites, but that the latter is necessary to
  achieve the former. Furthermore, we argue why and how causal considerations are
  necessary when assessing fairness in the presence of PAs by proposing a fictitious,
  normatively desired (FiND) world in which PAs have no causal effects. In practice,
  this FiND world must be approximated by a warped world in which the causal effects
  of the PAs are removed from the real-world data. Finally, we achieve greater linguistic
  clarity in the discussion of fairML. We outline algorithms for practical applications
  and present illustrative experiments on COMPAS data.
