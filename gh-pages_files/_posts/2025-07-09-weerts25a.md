title: Fourth European Workshop on Algorithmic Fairness (EWAF’25)
abstract: "The European Workshop on Algorithmic Fairness (EWAF) aims to foster dialogue
  between researchers working on algorithmic\r fairness in the context of Europe’s
  legal and societal framework, especially in light of the European Union’s attempts
  to promote\r ethical AI and the turn to AI for the common good. EWAF welcomes submissions
  from multiple disciplines, including but not\r limited to computer science, law,
  philosophy, and social science, as well as interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary
  work. The\r fourth edition (EWAF’25) will provide a dedicated venue for interdisciplinary
  discourse on algorithmic fairness via keynotes,\r paper presentations, a panel discussion,
  and interactive sessions."
