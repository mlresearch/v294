title: 'Uncertainty as a Primary Barrier for Trustworthy AI Under the EU AI Act: German
  SME Perspectives'
openreview: W4aYLd2mix
abstract: 'The European Union’s AI regulation, the EU AI Act, represents a significant
  shift from voluntary ethical frameworks to binding regulation, presenting implementation
  challenges particularly for resource-limited SMEs. Our mixed-methods research examined
  the EU AI Act’s impact on SMEs through surveys of German AI SMEs (N=21) and interviews
  with AI SMEs and industry stakeholders (N=13). In this extended abstract, we summarize
  our motivation and methods, and focus on providing results from the interviews.
  Our findings reveal that company size and compliance experience significantly affect
  estimated implementation capabilities. SMEs face considerable resource constraints
  across time, finances, and staffing. Implementation uncertainties - including definitional
  ambiguity, unclear scope, and insufficient guidance - drive strategic responses:
  delaying compliance efforts, modifying products to reduce regulatory burden, and
  frequently seeking external compliance expertise and certification. These results
  indicate that uncertainty emerges as the primary implementation barrier. Researchers
  can help reduce uncertainty by developing best-practice guidelines that support
  the AI Act’s trustworthy AI objectives. We conclude with recommendations for policymakers
  and researchers.'
