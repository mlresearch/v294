title: 'Reclaiming Human Rights for Platform Governance: Proposals for Restoring Their
  Centrality in the Era of Risks'
openreview: 1o3gH064O6
abstract: The Digital Services Act can potentially become a tool for change toward
  a more rights-abiding, competitive European digital platform ecosystem. However,
  as it currently stands, it is prone to be misused as a powerful tool for censorship
  as well as a tool to displace human rights as the backbone of the rule of law in
  modern democracies. Its risk-based and “new governance” approach to regulation puts
  rights on the back burner, and, while paying lip service to them, takes them off
  the center stage. This is problematic, for the incentives of the regulation and
  the oversight and enforcement mechanisms it establishes may channel the violation
  of fundamental rights. This paper proposes ways to correct this in the incipient
  enforcement and interpretative stage of the statute. In particular, we propose to
  adopt a working definition for “systemic risks”, clarify and narrow the individual
  risks identified, interpret them in light of human rights standards; take proportionality
  seriously and refine oversight; allow room for transparency and accountability for
  the oversight mechanisms, and bring back the State as a potential source of risks
  to human rights and other paramount values the DSA seeks to protect.
