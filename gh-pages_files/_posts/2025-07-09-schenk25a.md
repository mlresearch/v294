title: 'Fares on Fairness: Using a Total Error Framework to Examine the Role of Measurement
  and Representation in Training Data on Model Fairness and Bias'
openreview: tEhozQRDe7
abstract: Data-driven decisions, often based on predictions from machine learning
  (ML) models are becoming ubiquitous. For these decisions to be just, the underlying
  ML models must be fair, i.e., work equally well for all parts of the population
  such as groups defined by gender or age. What are the logical next steps if, however,
  a trained model is accurate but not fair? How can we guide the whole data pipeline
  such that we avoid training unfair models based on inadequate data, recognizing
  possible sources of unfairness early on? How can the concepts of data-based sources
  of unfairness that exist in the fair ML literature be organized, perhaps in a way
  to gain new insight? In this paper, we explore two total error frameworks from the
  social sciences, Total Survey Error and its generalization Total Data Quality, to
  help elucidate issues related to fairness and trace its antecedents. The goal of
  this thought piece is to acquaint the fair ML community with these two frameworks,
  discussing errors of measurement and errors of representation through their organized
  structure. We illustrate how they may be useful, both practically and conceptually.
