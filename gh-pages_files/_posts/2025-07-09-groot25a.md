title: 'Move forward or break ranks: Workshopping re-idealized explanation obligations
  to foster fundamental change and resistance to oppression'
openreview: FyfnaEMMGg
abstract: This paper presents a set of ‘duties of care’ that can be used to guide
  decision and explanation processes in complex socio-technical-legal environments.
  The duties support and strengthen existing explanation laws across legal domains.
  Informed by critical legal, philosophical, and technological insights, the model
  supports the conscientious challenges of decision makers and explainers who wish
  to avoid complicity in orchestrated harms. The duties support them and anyone working
  on fair decision making to tease out their knowledge-and-information needs and whether
  these are organized for, and which knowledge/deficits should raise alarm and are
  cause for resistance. The model was workshopped in two public agencies to test its
  ‘fit’ and usefulness in this salient decision-making sphere. This paper reports
  on the first impressions of what it takes to bring fundamental research directly
  into a practice context, and offers the workshop design to anyone interested to
  use in their own work.
