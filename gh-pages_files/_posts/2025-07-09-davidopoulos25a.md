title: Individual Fairness in Algorithmic Hiring
openreview: cGoSFlnar5
abstract: In this paper, we study individual fairness in job recommendations, and
  make two concrete contributions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
  to introduce the concept of $\varepsilon$-individual fairness to job recommendations;
  the smaller the value of $\varepsilon$, the stronger the guarantee of individual
  fairness is. Compared to existing definitions of individual fairness, e.g., for
  classification tasks, the output of a recommender is a ranked list of items, here
  jobs. Therefore, the novel aspect is that we propose the use of Kendallâ€™s $\tau$
  distance as a measure of similarity between recommendation lists. To ensure individual
  fairness, we introduce a novel post-processing approach. Initially, we cluster individuals
  with similar non-protected attributes. For each cluster, we construct a Kemeny-optimal
  aggregate recommendation list, which will serve as a template to generate individual
  recommendations. As a result, similar individuals will receive similar recommendations.
  Our experiments show that our method can effectively control the individual fairness
  guarantee, i.e., the value of $\varepsilon$.
