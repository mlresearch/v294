title: Equality insights in the development of fairer high-risk AI systems and the
  control of its discriminatory impacts
openreview: tbi1ph6jbB
abstract: In this paper we take as a reference the AI Act and the EU Directives on
  standards for equality bodies (2024/1499 and 2024/1500) with the aim to analyse
  how institutions can play a role in developing fairer AI systems. In parallel, we
  study the relevance of equality and non-discrimination experts to convey the scope
  and complexity of some concepts that are used in the non-discrimination field (such
  as intersectionality or structural discrimination) to the AI discipline, because
  they are not always easily traduced. We examine these questions regarding certain
  provisions of the AI Act that involve data governance, redress measures, the development
  of AI systems, the assessment of the impact on fundamental rights and the investigation
  regarding discriminatory results of AI systems. Furthermore, we argue that algorithmic
  discrimination, by shedding new light on the complex, varied and interconnected
  mechanisms by which discrimination operates, is pressing non-discrimination law
  to evolve from a simpler structure to a more sophisticated approach to inequality.
