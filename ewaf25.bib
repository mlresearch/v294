In parallel, we study the relevance of equality and non-discrimination experts to convey the scope and complexity of some concepts that are used in the non-discrimination field (such as intersectionality or structural discrimination) to the AI discipline, because they are not always easily traduced. We examine these questions regarding certain provisions of the AI Act that involve data governance, redress measures, the development of AI systems, the assessment of the impact on fundamental rights and the investigation regarding discriminatory results of AI systems. Furthermore, we argue that algorithmic discrimination, by shedding new light on the complex, varied and interconnected mechanisms by which discrimination operates, is pressing non-discrimination law to evolve from a simpler structure to a more sophisticated approach to inequality.},

To tackle such impact, researchers have focused on developing tools to mitigate algorithmic fairness issues and to support ML developers in their algorithmic fairness-centered practices. Yet, little has been triangulated about the concerns and practices of ML developers towards the broader impact of ML that arises from complex questions of distributive unfairness and unsustainable pillars underlying ML models (e.g., opaque task formulation, inappropriate datasets, energy-intensive infrastructures). In this qualitative study, we conducted 30 semi-structured interviews using a convenience sampling of developers with varying educational backgrounds and varying experience with ML and algorithmic fairness. We surface (mis)conceptions and (questionable) practices around harms and their mitigation. Our study reveals no standard across developers' concerns and practices, and tensions developers face when attempting to curb the undesirable impacts of ML models. These insights triangulate prior results on algorithmic fairness and shed light on various unsolved theoretical, design, methodological, and governance challenges. Our findings constitute a vital step forward to support developers and our broader community in navigating this growing, increasingly ubiquitous, footprint of ML.},

However, the underlying concept of fairness, i.e., the question of what fairness is, is rarely discussed, leaving a significant gap between centuries of philosophical discussion and the recent adoption of the concept in the ML community. In this work, we try to bridge this gap by formalizing a consistent concept of fairness and by translating the philosophical considerations into a formal framework for the training and evaluation of ML models in ADM systems. We argue that fairness problems can arise even without the presence of protected attributes (PAs), and point out that fairness and predictive performance are not irreconcilable opposites, but that the latter is necessary to achieve the former. Furthermore, we argue why and how causal considerations are necessary when assessing fairness in the presence of PAs by proposing a fictitious, normatively desired (FiND) world in which PAs have no causal effects. In practice, this FiND world must be approximated by a warped world in which the causal effects of the PAs are removed from the real-world data. Finally, we achieve greater linguistic clarity in the discussion of fairML. We outline algorithms for practical applications and present illustrative experiments on COMPAS data.},

    abstract = {Training machine learning models for fair decisions faces two key challenges: The fairness-accuracy trade-off results from enforcing fairness which weakens its predictive performance in contrast to an unconstrained model. The incompatibility of different fairness metrics poses another trade-off - also known as the impossibility theorem. Recent work identifies the bias within the observed data as a possible root cause and shows that fairness and predictive performance are in accord when predictive performance is measured on unbiased data. We offer a causal explanation for these findings using the framework of the FiND (fictitious and normatively desired) world, a "fair" world, where protected attributes have no causal effects on the target variable. Our contribution is twofold: First, we unify insights from previously separate lines of research and establish a new theoretical link that demonstrates how both the fairness-accuracy and the trade-off between conflicting fairness metrics are naturally resolved in this FiND world. Second, we propose appFiND, a new method for evaluating the quality of the FiND world approximation via pre-processing in real-world scenarios where the true FiND world is not observable. In simulations and empirical studies, we demonstrate that these pre-processing methods are successful in approximating the FiND world and resolving both trade-offs. Our results provide actionable solutions for practitioners to achieve fairness and high predictive performance simultaneously.},

    abstract = {Algorithmic fairness is an expanding field that addresses a range of discrimination issues associated with algorithmic processes. However, most works in the literature focus on analyzing it only from an ethical perspective, focusing on moral principles and values that should be considered in the design and evaluation of algorithms, while disregarding the epistemic dimension related to knowledge transmission and validation. However, this aspect of algorithmic fairness should also be included in the debate, as it is crucial to introduce a specific type of harm: an individual may be systematically excluded from the dissemination of knowledge due to the attribution of a credibility deficit/excess. In this work, we specifically focus on characterizing and analyzing the impact of this credibility deficit or excess on the diffusion of innovations on a societal scale, a phenomenon driven by individual attitudes and social interactions, and also by the strength of mutual connections. Indeed, discrimination might shape the latter, ultimately modifying how innovations spread within the network. In this light, to incorporate, also from a formal point of view, the epistemic dimension in innovation diffusion models becomes paramount, especially if these models are intended to support fair policy design. For these reasons, we formalize the epistemic properties of a social environment, by extending the well-established Linear Threshold Model (LTM) in an epistemic direction to show the impact of epistemic biases in innovation diffusion. Focusing on the impact of epistemic bias in both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios featuring optimal fostering policies, our results shed light on the pivotal role the epistemic dimension might have in the debate of algorithmic fairness in decision-making.},

    abstract = {Governments and organizations around the world in most jurisdictions have begun to operationalize principles establishing goals for fair, explainable, robust and trustworthy AI systems through AI governance tools. AI governance tools, socio-technical tools for assessing AI systems and their risks, are used to implement AI governance laws and policies. Understanding the types of measurements and analytical methods embedded within them and evaluating how these tools are implemented in various contexts helps to ensure they effectuate legal and policy goals. The research presented in this paper compares and analyzes the implementation of AI governance tools from Canada, Chile and Singapore. The analysis articulates commonalities among the tools and their implementations and illuminates areas for further analysis and potential refinement in relation to application and interpretation of the metrics and measures used by the tools, implementation of the tools themselves, as well as interests and motivations of tool end users. A key conclusion suggests that although AI governance tools require adequate assessment before they are made available, in some cases, it may be necessary to put some of these tools to use in context in order to articulate otherwise unknown or obscured shortcomings and areas of opportunity for adjustment, refinement, and improvement.},

    abstract = {Trustworthy AI methods like algorithmic fairness and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are becoming increasingly important in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Yet, while we use trustworthy AI tools to investigate the robustness of AI models, we rarely consider that the AI tools themselves are also models, that can also fail. In this paper, we present a case study highlighting how algorithmic fairness and XAI can lead to incorrect interpretation and bias mitigation when the underlying data suffers from systematic label bias.
    Label bias is common in crucial application domains such as healthcare or welfare AI -- a well known example being diseases that are underdiagnosed in certain demographic groups. In practice, moreover, the real labels are often inaccessible -- consider e.g. mental diseases such as major depressive disorder. Without access to true labels, it becomes challenging to estimate the magnitude of the bias. Prior work has documented well how label bias can propagate into biased predictive models, but the question of how (undetected) label bias affects Trustworthy AI tools remains unexplored. We design a case study using the well-known COMPAS dataset, which actually comes with two real sets of labels: One which is known to be highly biased, and one which is a well-accepted proxy for the underlying effect. This enables us to study label bias in a realistic way. We show how label bias leads to incorrect diagnosis of algorithmic bias, as well as incorrect mitigation. Also, we show that using XAI on models trained on biased labels highlights different important features than when training the same models on unbiased labels. When the label bias is unknown to the user, this can lead to incorrect interpretation of what causes different outcomes.
    In conclusion, we find that trustworthy AI in the face of label bias acts as a "medicine-after-death" (MAD) process, that addresses symptoms rather than the root causes of bias and is therefore ineffective at solving the problem.},

How can we guide the whole data pipeline such that we avoid training unfair models based on inadequate data, recognizing possible sources of unfairness early on? How can the concepts of data-based sources of unfairness that exist in the fair ML literature be organized, perhaps in a way to gain new insight? In this paper, we explore two total error frameworks from the social sciences, Total Survey Error and its generalization Total Data Quality, to help elucidate issues related to fairness and trace its antecedents. The goal of this thought piece is to acquaint the fair ML community with these two frameworks, discussing errors of measurement and errors of representation through their organized structure. We illustrate how they may be useful, both practically and conceptually.},

    abstract = {Explicit discrimination in job vacancies by using terms that refer to the candidate's background is illegal. Yet, it is still present in numerous vacancies, as was recently observed in the Netherlands. Labour market authorities have organized efforts for the detection of explicit discrimination, which are based on the detection of terms such as "young" or "male". However, many non-discriminatory phrases also contain these terms, such as "we are a young company" or "working with male patients". This results in a labour-intensive task to identify discriminatory job vacancies and act on them. AI language models are seen as promising innovations that may improve efficiency. Yet, their use by governmental bodies raises concerns and requires caution. In this paper, we critically examine the potential of AI and language models to support labour market authorities in detecting explicit discrimination. We do this through an investigation of the potential efficiency gain whilst centring user needs. For this, we first create a labelled data set concerning gender discrimination and investigate a variety of models in their ability to detect known and unforeseen discriminating terms in context. Results show that these methods can support detecting explicit gender discrimination by bringing substantial gains to precision and make sensible suggestions for new terms to detect in vacancies. We complement this with a critical reflection based on interviews with ten experts. They state that considerations on responsibly using AI and language models go beyond efficiency, emphasizing the importance of the underlying goal of discrimination detection. Is this goal reached within a reasonable investment and with acceptable side-effects? In conclusion, this applied use case demonstrated that AI and language models could meaningfully bring efficiency to labour market authorities' efforts to detect explicit discrimination in job vacancies. However, we advocate that, even for technologies used for common good, critical reflections beyond efficiency are needed to decide between AI and non-AI alternatives.},

Prior research suggests that mitigating bias may amplify membership inference risks for underrepresented groups. However, evaluations based on average-case metrics, such as attack success rate, often obscure vulnerabilities at low false-positive rates-an regime critical for real-world privacy. In this paper, we present an in-depth empirical study of membership inference under low false positive rate conditions, across three fair machine learning algorithms. Our analysis on the Law School, Bank Marketing, and COMPAS datasets reveal that standard threshold-based and population-based attacks underestimate privacy leaks, especially for sensitive subgroups. Motivated by this gap, we propose a subgroup-specific membership inference attack based on pairwise likelihood ratio tests. Our method models the null hypothesis more accurately: a target sample's outputs are statistically indistinguishable from those of non-members within the same sensitive subgroup. Our experiments show that a simple modification of an existing attack can achieve superior test power across the TPR-FPR curve-even at extremely low false positive rates, given an adversary with the same computational resources and access to data-establishing a robust foundation for more powerful, fine-grained privacy audits of fair learning algorithms.},

Despite the recent focus on fairness, insurance companies and software developers struggle to bridge the gap between fairness principles and practical implementation. Justifying digital price differentiation in terms of both fairness and profit is a socio-technical problem: it requires an integration of organizational processes, ethical-legal considerations on indirect discrimination, and technical fairness metrics and mitigation techniques. The paper proposes a structured list of 33 strategies designed to help organizations navigate these challenges, derived from a survey of Dutch insurance professionals, a systematic review of academic literature, and expert evaluations. The strategies are organized into five phases: Understand, Determine, Adjust, Evaluate and Communicate, with a particular emphasis on aligning fairness principles with actuarial accuracy and compliance with legal standards. This work contributes to the literature by offering an overview of actionable strategies that go beyond fairness metrics, addressing both technical and social aspects of digital price differentiation. Practically, the strategy list supports insurance professionals --- including data scientists, actuaries, auditors, compliance officers, and communication staff --- by (1) providing a comprehensive overview of strategies to balance fairness and profitability in digital price differentiation, and (2) offering a framework to structure organizational processes and internal communication around this balance.},

However, as it currently stands, it is prone to be misused as a powerful tool for censorship as well as a tool to displace human rights as the backbone of the rule of law in modern democracies. Its risk-based and ``new governance'' approach to regulation puts rights on the back burner, and, while paying lip service to them, takes them off the center stage. This is problematic, for the incentives of the regulation and the oversight and enforcement mechanisms it establishes may channel the violation of fundamental rights. This paper proposes ways to correct this in the incipient enforcement and interpretative stage of the statute. In particular, we propose to adopt a working definition for ``systemic risks'', clarify and narrow the individual risks identified, interpret them in light of human rights standards; take proportionality seriously and refine oversight; allow room for transparency and accountability for the oversight mechanisms, and bring back the State as a potential source of risks to human rights and other paramount values the DSA seeks to protect.},

In this extended abstract, we summarize our motivation and methods, and focus on providing results from the interviews. Our findings reveal that company size and compliance experience significantly affect estimated implementation capabilities. SMEs face considerable resource constraints across time, finances, and staffing. Implementation uncertainties - including definitional ambiguity, unclear scope, and insufficient guidance - drive strategic responses: delaying compliance efforts, modifying products to reduce regulatory burden, and frequently seeking external compliance expertise and certification. These results indicate that uncertainty emerges as the primary implementation barrier. Researchers can help reduce uncertainty by developing best-practice guidelines that support the AI Act's trustworthy AI objectives.

We investigate these policies in the context of an integrated risk tool for cardiovascular disease. This explores how the application of a more complex, and expensive, CPM on a subset of the population can improve fairness.

This paper examines the challenges of operationalizing algorithmic fairness in new contexts through a system-theoretic lens.

Drawing on system safety, a discipline that has dealt with complex safety problems in algorithmic systems for decades, we propose concepts and tools to support a system-theoretic approach to fairness.},

From the perspective of procedural fairness, however, stochastic mappings may imply arbitrary decisions. In this paper, we study and discuss the distribution of arbitrariness in popular randomized bias mitigation techniques which are currently available in standard fairness toolkits. We find that individuals belonging to different groups may have different risks for arbitrariness; furthermore, we observe different patterns of arbitrariness for different randomized mitigation strategies, and discuss possible causes for this general phenomenon.},

For each, we examine the underlying normative assumptions and commitments, highlighting tensions between design choices and the demands of pluralism. To meaningfully incorporate pluralism into LLM design, scholars must grapple with its conceptual complexity and contested dimensions. Crucially, this includes clarifying the goals of pluralistic alignment and articulating why pluralism matters for a given application context.},

This work summarizes our research on investigating the amplification of popularity bias in recommender systems within the entertainment sector. Analyzing datasets from three entertainment domains, music, movies, and anime, we demonstrate that an item's recommendation frequency is positively correlated with its popularity. As a result, user groups with little interest in popular content receive less accurate recommendations compared to those who prefer widely popular items.

Despite progress in recent decades, women remain underrepresented in most scientific fields, particularly in leadership roles and prestigious research positions. Generative AI holds promise for addressing long-standing inequalities in academia, such as assisting non-native English speakers in articulating their scientific discoveries more clearly and efficiently. Additionally, generative AI trained on scientific datasets could produce less biased and more comprehensive literature reviews. However, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit biases, failing to represent men and women equally in image generation. They also generate factually incorrect responses and fabricate non-existent references. In this paper, we examine references generated by the ChatGPT-4o model across 26 research areas within four main domains: Physical Sciences, Health Sciences, Social Sciences, and Life Sciences Specifically, we designed a prompt that instructed ChatGPT to generate literature reviews in various research topics and provide references including authors' full names, article titles, journals, publication years, and DOIs. We then compared these references across research areas to OpenAlex, an open-source database containing over 250 million scientific publications . Our study showed that ChatGPT-4o tends to cite more recent publications and papers with a higher ratio of women authors. It also highlights a high hallucination rate in generated citations, with ChatGPT-4o showing no significant improvement over previous versions, emphasizing the need for a critical evaluation of AI-generated references. The 2024 AI Index Report published by Stanford University stated that one of the key challenges in responsible AI development is the lack of standardization in AI reporting, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks. Our ongoing research aims to develop a standardized framework for evaluating LLMs in academic knowledge production by systematically comparing AI-generated literature reviews with real databases of published work.},

While transparency is commonly proposed as a solution to mitigate algorithmic opacity and promote fairness, we argue that transparency alone is insufficient because it often fails to translate into practical understanding or meaningful agency for users. Technical transparency may be obstructed by trade secrecy, technical complexity, and the dynamic nature of machine learning systems. Moreover, even when transparency is achieved, users may continue to act on alternative theories about algorithmic functioning, as demonstrated in our study. This highlights that algorithmic governance is co-constructed through social processes, user interpretations, and technological affordances. We conclude that efforts to improve algorithmic accountability must move beyond technical transparency and address the social dynamics that shape algorithmic systems in practice.},

This includes, first, their reliance on a narrow set of individual-level predictors -- most of which are protected attributes under global anti-discrimination laws -- overlooking valuable insights from migration studies that may improve predictive accuracy. Second, they guide refugee placement decisions without assessing group fairness, potentially reinforcing existing inequalities. Against this background, we draw on comprehensive refugee panel data from Germany and study the economic integration of refugees through the lens of predictive modeling. Specifically, we develop prediction models that integrate and test a wide range of integration factors from migration research. We then compare our extended model configurations with existing refugee-location matching algorithms, and evaluate group model performance to assess generalizability and fairness. Overall, we highlight the importance of integrating insights from migration studies into the development of algorithmic decision-making tools to improve their reliability and promote fair outcomes across diverse groups.},

This narrow focus often overlooks the complexity introduced by clients with conflicting or diverse fairness objectives. Such clients may contribute to the Federation without experiencing any improvement in their model's performance or fairness regarding their specific sensitive attributes. To evaluate Fair FL methods for global and individual client fairness in a reproducible and reliable manner, the need for standardized datasets becomes apparent. In this paper, we propose a preliminary framework to create benchmarking datasets that allow researchers and developers to evaluate Fair FL methods.

In general, the algorithmic auditing is a process of automated dynamic black-box assessment of real-world software system behavior. In a so-called sockpuppeting audit, impostor bots stimulate the platform with a simulated user behavior and observe the responses of the audited system (e.g., a recommender system). Algorithmic auditing is able to disclose interesting traits of AI systems (e.g., biases), which may be otherwise opaque. However, technical and methodological difficulties make audits costly, hard to reproduce, and hard to transfer cross-platform and cross-domain. To overcome this, the model-based algorithmic auditing introduces a platform-agnostic social media model which provides a simplified and aggregated representation of users, content, and interactions between them. The model supports or even automates challenging steps of the audit, like assisting human experts in creation of abstract audit scenarios, or predicting next user interactions. The reduction of manual effort makes the auditing more representative, cross-platform, and longitudinal, ultimately enabling more efficient oversight of social media algorithms by regulators, auditors and other stakeholders.},

Then, an enriched dataset with all publications in the same conferences and years is constructed from open-access research platforms such as Semantic Scholar and Open Alex. Publications are identified as closely related to one of two groups derived from initial annotations in the seed publications: (i) moral group and (ii) non-moral group. This is achieved by computing jaccard similarity reference overlap between paper publications and constructing a similarity-based network, followed by backbone extraction and ego network extraction. Diversity scores for research collaborations are calculated enabling a statistical analysis with the two groups of publications. Results from human validation reveal that despite the developed method successfully constructs a similarity-based measure, it does not reliably infer shared moral values. Publications closely tied to a publication categorized as moral do not necessarily share the same values, despite having a high overlap based on shared references. Additional results show that the diversity characteristics of research collaborations in both groups do not have a statistically significant relationship with the moral classification. While there is some diversity, the general observations, however, show a significant underrepresentation of women and a concentration of researchers from a few nationalities, elite institutions, and technology companies, predominantly from the global north.},

The experiment varied the visibility of the offender's race to the officers and also experimented with informing the officers of the model's accuracy. Lee (2025) finds that when the race of the offender is disclosed, officers tend to adjust their predictions towards the algorithm's assessment. However, the adjustments made by the officers showed significant racial disparities: there was a noticeable gap in initial rearrest predictions between Black and White offenders, even when controlling for the characteristics of the offenders. The police tended to predict higher rearrest rates for Black offenders only when race was visible, but reduced their predictions after seeing the algorithm's assessment. However, not all police officers reduced their predictions after seeing the algorithm's predictions. Only Black police officers made significant downward adjustments following the algorithm's prediction, while White police officers did not significantly alter their assessments.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we study individual fairness in job recommendations, and make two concrete contributions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of $\varepsilon$-individual fairness to job recommendations; the smaller the value of $\varepsilon$, the stronger the guarantee of individual fairness is. Compared to existing definitions of individual fairness, e.g., for classification tasks, the output of a recommender is a ranked list of items, here jobs. Therefore, the novel aspect is that we propose the use of Kendall's $\tau$ distance as a measure of similarity between recommendation lists. To ensure individual fairness, we introduce a novel post-processing approach. Initially, we cluster individuals with similar non-protected attributes. For each cluster, we construct a Kemeny-optimal aggregate recommendation list, which will serve as a template to generate individual recommendations. As a result, similar individuals will receive similar recommendations. Our experiments show that our method can effectively control the individual fairness guarantee, i.e., the value of $\varepsilon$.},
